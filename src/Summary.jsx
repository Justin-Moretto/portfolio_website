        Prior to Covid-19, I'd been working in music and audio, with some part-time manual labour and video game QA testing jobs sprinkled in. When the pandemic lock-downs started to put great strain on my financial future, I decided to do something I'd been thinking about for a while, and pivot to a career in tech. In February of 2021, I completed LightHouse Labs' Web Development bootcamp, and from there got an internship working at Shiphaul Logistics, a small startup company where I gained valuable experience working with a large code base (React frontend, Firebase backend). Currently, I am searching for more permanent position where I can continue to grow and provide value.

        I am young, friendly, hard-working, a good communicator and calm under pressure. I learn quick, I care about my work and I enjoy doing it. I value growth, communication and authenticity.

        Although I formally studied web development, I have dabbled in game development as a hobby, and I'm trying to sharpen my Unity and C# skills in my spare time.
